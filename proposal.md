In this paper I propose to extract, describe, and contextualize the social
network of significant intellectual figures that contributed to the emergence
of modernism in the West. Using the entirety of the Blue Mountain Project
corpus, along with several related archives, I will apply computational
techniques to create a connected map of authors, contributors, and cited
sources. The map will reveal patterns of influence and reception over time. I
am particularly interested in the movement of ideas across cultures and
geographies. The paper will also contain a methodological argument,
identifying the periodical as an important unit for literary analysis and
historiography.
